# ESSENTIAL
  √ firmware
  √ snapper (leaving bug open: still appears underneath everything)
  √ tracstar functional
  √ app themes sorted

# NICE TO HAVE
  * venv
  * SWD-ready firmware (ELF format w/ bootloader)
  √ internationalization dictionary for AppMenu
  √ set desktop wallpaper
  X Fork ProFontIIx -> ProFontGfx. Add close button, scroll buttons, heart glyph as in maze3d readme, any other widget glyphs which pygame-gui uses. - Attempted - mangled format. Pausing for now.


# TODOS
Individual apps are listed below.
Each app has 2 todo sections: one for bugs, and one for features.

## AppMenuPanel/Snapper
### Bugs
    * They should always be above all other elements. Instead, they sometimes appear beneath other elements. starting_height has inconsistent effect.
    * AppMenuPanel: App names run offscreen if list is too long. Change to scrolling, full vertical columns.
### Features
    * Modify AppMenuPanel to post events on what it is doing (opening panel, closing panel, launching apps) to make it cleaner to interface Snapper with it (hiding/showing Snapper, etc.)

## SnakeWM
### Bugs
    * sound: all apps will crash if no audio device
    * games/zap: crashes at launch if no audio output device
    * image/ditherbox: connect dither script to GUI
### Features
    * sound/piano: redraw to fit beepy screen
    * bmpfont.py slow performance - ensure it uses convert()
  * Bluetooth settings automation (see bluetooth-robot.py)
  * Issues with apps:
    * games/towerdef: needs port to snakeware
    * games/zap: crashes at launch if no audio output device
    * image/ditherbox: connect dither script to GUI
    * sound: all apps will crash if no audio device
    * sound/piano: redraw to fit beepy screen
