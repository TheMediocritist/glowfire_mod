# Piano
A miniature piano.

Also includes a repetition game, in which you repeat notes.
Keys can be activated by mouse or keyboard.
The keys on the keyboard's home row (S to L) play the white keys, the black keys are on E, R, Y/Z, U, I. (So this should work with QWERTY, QWERTZ, and AZERTY keyboard layouts.) The C major chord keys needed for repetition mode can also be played with the 1, 2, 3, 4 and cursor keys.

Volume can be adjusted with the V and B keys, the octave can be changed with N and M. C toggles sustain mode.

Press Space to stop all sounds. If you click a key with the mouse, move the mouse away and release the button, you can create a note that plays permanently.

There is no way to really win or lose in repetition mode, your score in the title bar simply keeps increasing if you get a sequence right. If you want to generate a different melody, just switch to piano mode and back again.
